# Agent Current State Gate

This file is the compact, machine-checked handoff point for the next coding
loop. It prevents an agent from proposing implementation work that is already
complete in the delivery ledger.

## How to use it

Before planning or proposing a goal, run:

```bash
npm run agent:state
```

Before handing a new task to an implementer, add the target IDs to the task
contract and run:

```bash
npm run agent:task:check -- .agent/tasks/<task>.md
```

The completed L0–L11.5 rows in `docs/06-loop-engineering.md` are closed for
new implementation. Reopening one requires an explicit `## Reopen
justification` section in the task contract with a concrete regression,
security finding, or changed requirement.

## Last audited repository state

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Local base commit | `6565a3c` (subsequent changes are on `codex/webhook-registration-ux`) |
| Release PR | `#27` — merged |
| Quality gate | See individual slice reports; local verification includes pre-existing, uncommitted CI changes |
| Source tree | Current branch contains the GitHub Create Issue/idempotency, Add Label, Add Comment, Merge Pull Request operations, and the signed GitHub Issue opened, Pull request opened, Push, and Workflow run completed triggers |
| Uncommitted changes | Existing CI/OPS edits are preserved separately; the CI scope optimization has a documented deployment-gap risk and must not be released without correction |

## Closed follow-up slices

- `P2-1` — GitHub connector vertical slices complete locally through the current acceptance boundary: separate encrypted connector credential, mock/live-guarded Create Issue, readiness, retry/error classification, idempotency, Add Label, Add Comment, Merge Pull Request, Issue opened, Pull request opened, Push, and Workflow run completed. No real provider smoke is implied; that remains owner-approved external validation.
- `WEBHOOK-REG-1` — Per-workflow GitHub signing secrets and compact editor guidance implemented locally; `npm run verify` passed (154 API, 19 web, 30 Playwright). Migration has not been applied and real delivery remains unverified.
- `GH-UX-2` — Bounded GitHub repository pagination, manual/expression fallback, and recoverable picker states implemented locally; `npm run verify` passed with 31 Playwright tests. Provider calls in tests were mocked.
- `OPS-2` — Status-based saved views scoped to user/workspace, server-side triage and retention policy visibility implemented locally. Full quality gate passed; both new migrations were applied to an isolated fresh PostgreSQL database and an isolated synthetic upgrade from `6565a3c`. Workflow, date, and mode filters remain future extensions; production migration and live validation are outstanding.
- `GOOGLE-UX-1` — Google Sheets and Drive text-file pickers implemented locally through an owner-scoped server proxy. Full gate passed with mocked providers; real OAuth resource discovery remains unverified.
- `GH-HARDEN-1` — Signed GitHub setup pings are acknowledged without running inactive workflows; repeated deliveries use registration-scoped delivery IDs. Full gate passed with mocked providers. Deduplication is bounded by execution retention and is not replay protection: the delivery header is not covered by the body HMAC.

## Next approved slices

These are the only currently approved follow-up directions. A task must target
one of these IDs or explicitly reopen a completed ledger slice.

| ID | Outcome | Status | Owner/evidence boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OPS-1` | Complete the VPS production qualification evidence: DNS/TLS, env shape, backup/isolated restore, rollback, and fixed-target smoke | operator-gated | Requires operator access and must not print secrets |
| `LIVE-1` | Validate one explicitly approved real Steam → Google Chat run plus configured OAuth callbacks | owner-input-required | Requires user credentials and explicit external-side-effect approval |

## Closed boundary

The following are not next implementation goals because they are already
implemented and verified in the repository ledger: authentication and identity
readiness, workspace/dashboard/workflow lifecycle, editor and node library,
credential lifecycle and dependency references, execution engine and worker qualification, node debug,
Go Live/activation guards, execution center, notification adapters, theme and
Relay-inspired design system, accessibility hardening, CI/CD, immutable image
deployment, release security contracts, production release candidate
documentation, dense-canvas navigation/minimap, and the reusable provider
resource-picker foundation.

## Non-negotiable loop

```text
read this state → select one non-closed ID → define proof
→ implement one vertical slice → run agent:task:check
→ run npm run verify → review diff and CI → merge only with owner approval
```

If no item can proceed without credentials, operator evidence, or a product
choice, report that blocker instead of inventing another feature or repeating a
completed slice.
